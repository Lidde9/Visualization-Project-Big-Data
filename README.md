# Visualization Project

Project #3 - Big Data Analysis using Data Golf
This project uses datagolf.com API in order to analyze the upcoming ryder cup tournament. Data is retrieved through the API to a total size of 3.3k rows and 87 columns. The data is then sliced to analyze only 24 players and their stats covering up to two years of stats.

The data is used to answer the following questions:

What team is favoured in the Ryder Cup?

What are each teams key strengths/weaknesses?

Was Ludvig Ã…berg a wild pick?

This document includes the following:

Info on Data Golf API
Importing necessary libraries
Using API to retrieve data
Cleaning, merging, categorizing and relabbeling data
Visualizing data using various libraries and plot types
The end result is summarised in a presentation.
